            <h2>About This Project</h2>

            <p>
              <strong>The Speculative Style Studio</strong> is an interactive
              tool that explores a deceptively simple question:
              <em
                >How does the same outfit mean completely different things
                depending on who's wearing it and where they're wearing it?</em
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              We all know that clothing is more than fabric and stitching. What
              you wear sends messages—sometimes intentional, often not. A hoodie
              can feel like comfort and privacy to one person, but surveillance
              and suspicion to another. A business suit might convey authority
              in a boardroom, but threat in a residential neighborhood. These
              shifts in meaning aren't about the garment itself; they're about
              <strong>identity, history, power, and context</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3>What Can You Do Here?</h3>

            <p>This studio has three interactive parts:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Choose an Avatar</strong> — Select from multiple body
                types, skin tones, and gender expressions to see how style
                operates across different bodies. There's no single "neutral"
                model here; representation matters.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Dress Them Up</strong> — Pick from archetypal clothing
                items: a hoodie, a business suit, sportswear, a zoot suit, and
                more. These aren't branded products. They're cultural symbols
                with histories and meanings.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Change the Context</strong> — Select different social
                settings and scenarios: a suburban mall, a runway, an Instagram
                post, a sports broadcast, or a specific historical era. Watch
                how the same person in the same outfit is perceived entirely
                differently.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What You'll Discover</h3>

            <p>
              As you experiment, three layers of analysis reveal what's really
              happening:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Reception</strong> — How visible or invisible is this
                person? Do they appear threatening, respectable, authoritative,
                or authentic? How commodified are they? These shifts show how
                bias and stereotypes shape perception.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Affect</strong> — What does it <em>feel</em> like to
                inhabit this body, in this outfit, in this moment? You'll read
                first-person accounts that capture the emotional texture of
                these experiences—worry, confidence, invisibility, power,
                vulnerability.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>History</strong> — Every garment has a story. Learn
                about the Zoot Suit Riots. Understand how athletes' bodies
                become brand ambassadors. Explore how certain clothing styles
                are read as rebellion, performance, or transgression depending
                on who wears them.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why This Matters</h3>

            <p>
              Fashion is often treated as frivolous—just aesthetic choice. But
              it's actually a <strong>battleground</strong> where culture, race,
              gender, class, and history collide. When marginalized communities
              adopt a style, it gets pathologized. When dominant culture adopts
              it, it gets praised as "bold" or "edgy." This project makes that
              hypocrisy visible.
            </p>

            <p>
              By remixing avatars, garments, and contexts, you'll see how the
              same outfit accumulates different meanings across bodies and
              spaces. You'll understand that fashion isn't just personal
              expression—it's a site where systems of power operate invisibly,
              shaping how we're seen, valued, and treated.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is <strong>speculative</strong> because it's designed to make
              you question: What are we communicating with what we wear? Whose
              interpretations count? And how do we design a more equitable
              relationship with fashion, identity, and visibility?
